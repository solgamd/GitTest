            <h4>My Past</h4>
            <p>I learned work ethic from feeding cows, cleaning toilets, and baking muffins––most of which started
                around 5
                or 6AM (though these jobs weren't performed in the same place, don't worry.) Other jobs I've done:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>IT support</li>
                <li>student advising and career coaching</li>
